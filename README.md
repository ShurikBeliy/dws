# Django Web Store (DWS)
Django Web Store is a very simple and clean but powerful project for your business.
Use this project to create web store for your own business.
In the DWS you can create categories for items and different filters for items.
We used Django3, Sass and TypeScript4 in our project and prepare styles and scripts that you can change easily for your future projects.
We decided not to use bootstrap and keep our project clean. Instead of bootstrap we are create simple styles using BEM approach.
